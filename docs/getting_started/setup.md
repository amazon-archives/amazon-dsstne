# Setup
DSSTNE requires a GPU to run. You can setup and run DSSTNE in several different ways

* [Setting up with Docker](#setup-on-docker)
* [Setting up on AWS](#setup-on-aws)
* [Setting up on a dev machine](#setup-on-a-dev-machine)

## Setup on Docker
[Docker](http://docker.com/) helps to containerize your installation without effecting any builds locally. The [Dockerfile](../../Dockerfile) is provided for DSSTNE and you can build a docker out of that.

### Matching GPU driver versions
**The NVIDIA driver version in your Docker image must exactly match the version installed on the host**
The `Dockerfile` uses CUDA 7.0 with driver version 346.72. You can verify the installed version on your
machine by running the `nvidia-smi` tool.

```bash
nvidia-smi|grep Version
| NVIDIA-SMI 346.72     Driver Version: 346.72
```

If your machine does not have 346.72 installed, then you must update the `Dockerfile` to install the
same driver that your host machine has.
Note that we have only fully tested installation with CUDA 7.0.28 and driver 346.72 on the host system.

### Creating the Docker image
 Download the code.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne.git
```
Then build the image locally. Make sure there are at least 10GB free on the root of your [docker runtime](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/daemon/).
```bash
cd amazon-dsstne/
docker build -t amazon/dsstne .
```

Once the Docker Image has been created ensure that you start the docker with *privileged* mode so that you can access the GPU drivers
```bash
docker run -it --privileged amazon/dsstne /bin/bash
```

## Setup on AWS
You can also launch a [GPU based AWS instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using_cluster_computing.html) from *ami-d6f2e6bc* which has all the prerequisites build in properly. The image is currently availble in us-east-1 region (N.Virginia in AWS Console). [Download the code and build](#download-the-code-and-build)

## Setup on a dev machine
Instructions are provided for installation on Ubuntu linux machines.

### Prerequisites
* [Setup GCC](#gcc-setup) : GCC compiler with C++11 is required .
* [Setup CuBLAS](#cublas-setup) : Blas Libraries
* Cuda Toolkit >= 7.0 is required
* [Setup OpenMPI](#openmpi-setup) : CUDA aware OpenMPI is required .
* [Setup NetCDF](#netcdf-setup) : NetCDF is the native format which DSSTNE engine supports
* [Setup JsonCPP](#jsoncpp-setup) : Configurations are parsed through Json
* [Setup CUB](#cub-setup) : Dependent CUDA libraries which is required by DSSTNE

#### GCC Setup
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get install gcc
sudo apt-get install g++
```
#### Cublas Setup
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
sudo apt-get install -y libatlas-base-dev
```

#### OpenMPI Setup
MPI is used across in DSTTNE to allow multi gpu modelling. OpenMPI package is used as the MPI Platform
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
sudo apt-get -y install make
wget http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.8/downloads/openmpi-1.8.2.tar.gz
tar xvfz openmpi-1.8.2.tar.gz
cd openmpi-1.8.2
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/openmpi
make
sudo make install
```

#### NetCDF Setup
NetCDF is the format which is supported inherently from DSSTNE engine. It is required to install
* [Setup Hdf5](#hdf5-setup)
* [Setup Zlib](#zlib-setup)
* [Setup NetCDF](#netcdf-setup)
* [Setup NetCDFC++](#netcdfc++-setup)

#### HDF5 Setup
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
wget ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4/hdf5-1.8.9.tar.gz
tar xvfz hdf5-1.8.9.tar.gz
cd hdf5-1.8.9
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
```

#### Zlib Setup
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
wget ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
tar xvf zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
cd zlib-1.2.8
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
#### Netcdf Setup
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
wget ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4.1.3.tar.gz
tar xvf netcdf-4.1.3.tar.gz
cd netcdf-4.1.3
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
```
#### Netcdfc++ Setup
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
wget http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/ftp/netcdf-cxx4-4.2.tar.gz
tar xvf netcdf-cxx4-4.2.tar.gz
cd netcdf-cxx4-4.2
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
```

#### JsonCPP Setup
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
sudo apt-get -y install cmake
wget https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/archive/svn-import.tar.gz
tar xvfz svn-import.tar.gz
cd jsoncpp-svn-import
mkdir -p build/release
cd build/release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DJSONCPP_LIB_BUILD_SHARED=OFF -G "Unix Makefiles" ../..
make
sudo make install
```

#### CUB Setup
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
wget https://github.com/NVlabs/cub/archive/1.5.2.zip
sudo apt-get install -y unzip
unzip 1.5.2.zip
sudo cp -rf cub-1.5.2/cub/ /usr/local/include/
```

### Download the code and build.
```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit
git clone https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne.git
cd amazon-dsstne/src/amazon/dsstne
# Add the mpiCC and nvcc compiler in the path
export PATH=/usr/local/openmpi/bin:/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
make
export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH
```

Try running some [examples](examples.md).
