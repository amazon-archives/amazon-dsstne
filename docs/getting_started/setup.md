# Setup Guide

DSSTNE requires a GPU to run. This guide covers two different ways that you can setup and run DSSTNE:

* [Setup on AWS using Docker](#setup-on-aws-using-docker)
* [Setup up on your own development machine](#setup-on-your-own-development-machine)

## Setup on AWS using Docker

The first option is to run DSSTNE on AWS, taking advantage of [Docker](http://docker.com/) to containerize your installation. We have provided an AMI and Dockerfile that can be used to build and run DSSTNE on a GPU-based EC2 instance.

### Dockerfile

A [Dockerfile](../../Dockerfile) has been provided as part of the DSSTNE source code, and you can build a Docker image out of that. Our Dockerfile is designed to be used with a Docker plugin called [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker), which facilitates communication between a Docker container and the GPU on the host.

When you build this Docker image, all of the dependencies for building DSSTNE will be fetched from third-party sources. By building this image, you are responsible for reading and accepting the relevant software licenses.

### AMI with nvidia-docker

You can launch a [GPU-based EC2 instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using_cluster_computing.html) from *ami-fe173884*, which has Docker and nvidia-docker installed. This AMI also includes NVIDIA drivers, and is currently available in the us-east-1 region (N.Virginia in AWS Console).

You can create a new EC2 instance by following the instructions in the [EC2 Launch Instance Wizard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-25c0eb32) (this link will take you directly to the wizard).

### Login to EC2 instance via SSH

Once you have launched your new GPU-based EC2 instance, you will need to log in as the 'ubuntu' user. Once you have successfully logged in, ensure that you can start a Docker container that can access the GPU drivers on the host. You can do this by running `nvidia-smi` in a new container:

```bash
nvidia-docker run --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi
```

The output should be similar to the following - with no errors or running processes, and indicating that version 367.57 of the NVIDIA GPU Drivers are active:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If that all works, you can proceed to building a DSSTNE Docker image.

### Build the Docker image

To build the latest Docker image, you will need to clone the DSSTNE source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne.git
```

Then build the image locally:

```bash
cd amazon-dsstne/
docker build -t amazon-dsstne .
```

Note that this will take a while, as it will build DSSTNE's dependencies from source. Feel free to get a cup of coffee while you wait.

### Test the Docker image

```bash
nvidia-docker run --rm -it amazon-dsstne predict
```

The output should look like the following (the missing argument error is expected):

```
Error: Missing required argument: -d: dataset_name is not specified.
Predict: Generates predictions from a trained neural network given a signals/input dataset.
Usage: predict -d <dataset_name> -n <network_file> -r <input_text_file> -i <input_feature_index> -o <output_feature_index> -f <filters_json> [-b <batch_size>] [-k <num_recs>] [-l layer] [-s input_signals_index] [-p score_precision]
    -b batch_size: (default = 1024) the number records/input rows to process in a batch.
    -d dataset_name: (required) name for the dataset within the netcdf file.
    -f samples filterFileName .
    -i input_feature_index: (required) path to the feature index file, used to tranform input signals to correct input feature vector.
    -k num_recs: (default = 100) The number of predictions (sorted by score to generate). Ignored if -l flag is used.
    -l layer: (default = Output) the network layer to use for predictions. If specified, the raw scores for each node in the layer is output in order.
    -n network_file: (required) the trained neural network in NetCDF file.
    -o output_feature_index: (required) path to the feature index file, used to tranform the network output feature vector to appropriate features.
    -p score_precision: (default = 4.3f) precision of the scores in output
    -r input_text_file: (required) path to the file with input signal to use to generate predictions (i.e. recommendations).
    -s filename (required) . to put the output recs to.
```

If this is what you see, you're ready to move on to the [examples]. Note that before running the examples, you should start a shell on a fresh Docker container:

```bash
nvidia-docker run -it amazon-dsstne /bin/bash
```
